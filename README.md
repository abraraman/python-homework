# PyBank: Financial Records Analysis

 ## For this project, I have created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a demo company, using the financial dataset titled "budget_data.csv. The  dataset is composed of two columns; Date and Profit/Losses. The Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

* Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

### The script can be found inside the PyBank directory, inside the file "main.ipynb"
